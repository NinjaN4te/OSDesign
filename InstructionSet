; opcode:
;   the opcode is obviously the opcode of the mnemonic
; operand:
;   operands specifies how many operands there are and what kind it is:
;     in general, it has the form XY, where:
;       X is the number of bytes of the operands, provide 0 for no operands
;       Y is the type of operand. The types available are as follows:
;         A: and address
;         D: a displacement
;         I: an immediate value
;         0: no operands 
; T0:
;   the number of clock cycles the instruction will take to complete
; 
; MC1..MC4
;   the external operation the instruction performs at the current machine cycle
;   ... - unused, ie: instruction has completed
;   M1R - the basic M1 cycle of fetch and decode
;   MRD - memory read
;   MWR - memory write
;   IOR - I/O read
;   IOW - I/O write
;   NON - no external operation, only internal computation, so no external effects
;   INT - interrupt cycle
