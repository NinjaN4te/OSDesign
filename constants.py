# flag registers
# the Flag Register F consists of the following bits:
# 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
# Z N H C 0 0 0 0
# ---------------
# Zero Flag (Z):
#   This bit is set when the result of a math operation
#   is zero or two values match when using the CP
#   instruction.
# Subtract Flag (S):
#   This bit is set if a subtraction was performed in the
#   last math instruction.
# Half Carry Flag (H):
#   This bit is set if a carry occurred from the lower
#   nibble in the last math operation (if carry from bit 3).
# Carry Flag (C):
#   This bit is set if a carry occurred from the last
#   math operation (if carry from bit 7) or if
#   register A is the smaller value when executing
#   the CP instruction.

AFFC = -2 # the default input value, indicates that the flag is affected by the operation
