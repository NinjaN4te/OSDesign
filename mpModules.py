  # list:
  #   A: the accumulator register
  #   ACT: the temporary accumulator/buffer register before entering the ALU unit
  #   CU: the CU, control unit, of the microprocessor that coordinates everything in the MPU
  #   CTRL: control section of microprocessor, includes the IR, decoder, and controller sequencer
  #   FLAGS: the flags or 'F' register
  #   RAM: the block of internal registers W,Z,B,C,D,E,H,L,SP,PC
  #   TMP: the temporary register
  def A(self):

    yield

  # Control Unit CU
  #   the CU coordinates everything within the microprocessor. it synchronizes/sequences
  #   the entire system. it will perform the memory  fetch and decode the contents of
  #   the IR to give the correct sequence of internal and external signals for the
  #   controller sequencer to dispatch (ie: which executes the instruction)
  #   in addition, the CU also is programmed to 'know' how many words each instruction #   has so it fetches the correct number of bytes for every instruction. it is also
  #   the one that pipelines the instruction executions to save clock cycles, like the
  #   ADD r example in the reference, ie: whether overlap is possible. Only the CU can
  #   see the W and Z registers. it also knows when a jump was made and behaves accordingly
  # IOW, this is where most of the code is going to be.
  def CU(self):
    # the execution loop of the cpu has three phases:
    #   fetch, decode execute    --repeat ad nauseum
    #   the cpu execution will be discretely simulated using machine cycles and clock cycles.
    #   the clock cycles will also sometimes be referred to as 'states' here.
    #   one machine cycle = four clock cycles/states, notated M1,M2,... and T1,T2,... respectively
    #   so now to elaborate on each phase:
    #   FETCH:
    #     T1)
    #       address in PC is deposited onto the Address Bus to be transferred to MM. MM will then
    #         read the address on the Address Bus and decode it into some actual address of a
    #         memory location.
    #     T2)
    #       PC is incremented (PC=PC+1) which memory is reading (ie, while MM decodes and accesses
    #         the memory location at the address). At the end of T2, the contents
    #         of the memory location specified by the provided address will be available to
    #         be transferred into the MPU (microprocessing unit).
    #     T3)
    #       the instruction contained at the specified memory location is deposited onto the
    #         data bus and is transferred into the IR (instruction register) of the MPU.
    #   DECODE & EXECUTE:
    #     T4)
    #       the instruction that was transferred into the IR at the end of T3 is now
    #         decoded and executed. This takes at least one machine state (T4), but
    #         possibly more, and hence the varying number of cycles to execute a
    #         given instruction.
    #    *T5)
    #       if an instruction needs more than 4 clock cycles or states or 1 machine cycle
    #         to execute, T4 of M1 will transition directly into T1 of M2
    # create dictionary of what to do on which states/clock cycles
